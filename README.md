## Projects Overview

### 1. Data Mining: Census Data Analysis

#### Description
This project utilizes census data to explore data analysis techniques and supervised learning models. It focuses on predicting individuals' income class (above or below 50K per year) based on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The project includes preprocessing, feature exploration, and the application of various classification algorithms.

#### Key Highlights
- **Data Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy and Confusion Matrix

#### Tools and Libraries
- Python
- `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

#### Key Files
- `dados_do_censo_anderson83.py`: Main script for data preprocessing and model implementation
- `adult.data`: Dataset file
